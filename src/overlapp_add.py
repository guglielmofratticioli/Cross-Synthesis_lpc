""" 
CHAT GPT on small fluctuations : 
However, even if the COLA condition is satisfied, 
small error fluctuations can still occur due to the windowing process 
and the overlap-add synthesis procedure, 
as I explained earlier. These error fluctuations can be minimized by choosing an 
appropriate window function and overlap factor, but they cannot be completely eliminated.

Therefore, while the COLA condition is necessary for perfect reconstruction, 
it does not guarantee that there will be no error fluctuations in the reconstructed signal. """
